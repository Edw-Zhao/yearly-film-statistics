# About This Project / Me

 This is a simple API project that displays statistics of theatrical film
 releases for the desired input year. This was a learning experience for
 me to simultaneously learn JSON data handling with Vue.js as a new
 framework to reach my aspirations of a career in front-end development.
 The data presented are borrowed from
